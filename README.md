### Introduction to our Problem
The problem we aim to address is the difficulty of socialising and making friends at University. The problem mostly is observed in students that are transitioning from high school into university. However, this problem is not limited to high school students as international students also face difficulty making friends. They have often left their families and old lives behind to attempt to build a better life but face difficulty adjusting and coping with the new environment that confronts them. International students make up ~38% of the student demographic in UNSW (UNSW Annual Report 2018) so it is a considerable problem. Furthermore, for local students, it is comparatively easier to make friends in high school as students have shared classes and break schedules. This in conjunction with the fact that they are not taught advanced social skills means they may face difficulty in university. This is because in university, making friends requires significantly more effort as everyone works to a different schedule. Thus, as we can extrapolate, this problem is affecting the entire student body of university - both local and international students face difficulty making friends either due to a lack of social ability or being put in an environment drastically different than what they were accustomed to.

### Prototype Implementation

For our system propsal a Low-Fidelity and High-Fidelity Prototype have been designed, they can be found under the following links:

The actual implementation will make use of ReactJS for the frontend with bootstrap to speed up development and ExpressJS for the backend.
