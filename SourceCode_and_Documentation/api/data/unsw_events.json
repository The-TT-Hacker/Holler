We strongly encourage everyone who is interested in this inquiry to apply to join the team who will be writing this submission as a contributor. The team will be led by our Policy Submissions Directors, Sarah Lu and Isobel Patmore.\n\nWe particularly encourage first year students to apply to gain an experience into what policy submissions are and to develop new skills and experiences. This inquiry is particularly well suited for students new to policy submissions. Keep in mind that this submission involves reading and commenting on proposed legislation.\n\nThis submission is about the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Climate Trigger) Bill 2020. This legislation proposes amending the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, to introduce penalties for an individual or corporate body undertaking actions which involve mining operations, drilling exploration, land clearing or as specified in the regulations (emissions-intensive actions), if the action has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the environment. \n\nREGISTRATION FORM: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9B2LFB31RZQ6Snb50nEBVRsELLhIQq5YfJDOnm_JxtqGG2w/viewform",
